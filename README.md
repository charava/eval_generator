## Description

Writing evals can be a major time-suck. We wanted to create a super simple interface for writing evals...that actually minimizes the time one will have to spend _writing_. After interviewing Sean, it was apparent that he had a very particular way he liked to write his evals and already had specific content he tended to recycle. Rather than have him manually copy-and-paste to reuse parts of other evals when crafting evals, we want him to be able to just _fill in the blank_. 

There are four Eval templates that Sean can toggle between: Fall 9th, Spring 9th, Fall 11th, and Spring 11th. Each Eval is specific to that grade and time of year, and has unique "fill-in-the-blank" inputs. After writing his eval, he can simply click "Copy to Clipboard" to retrieve his crafted eval.

## Here's some ideas for future exploration: 

- Connect a database so that Sean can save his Evals
- Rather than input direct sentences, input bullet points
- Use generative AI to pass each eval through for paraphrasing
- Add a note-taking UI as well that syncs to a databse
