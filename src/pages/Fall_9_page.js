// WHAT DOES THIS FILE DO?
// This is one of the pages on the website
// since this is a mad-libs style eval generator, this page renders a paragraph
// with various inputs (drop downs and text) scattered throughout
// that then gets stored in the state variable 'eval'
// We also added the feature, copy to clipboard, to allow Sean to easily
// move his generated evals to a spreadsheet or paste it into the Nexus app
